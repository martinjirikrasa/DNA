DNA, the carrier of genetic information in living things.
DNA is really just a sequence of molecules called nucleotides, arranged into a particular shape (a double helix).
Every human cell has billions of nucleotides arranged in sequence. Each nucleotide of DNA contains one of four 
different bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T).
Some portions of this sequence (i.e., genome) are the same, or at least very similar, across almost all humans,
but other portions of the sequence have a higher genetic diversity and thus vary more across the population.

In a databases i have some individuals and ech colunmn coresponds to number of particular genomes in their gene.

My program finds the number of genome sequences from one of my examples (1-12.txt in sequences)
If my program finds excact number of genome sequences and matches them with the same
number in my database, then it prints the name of the individual.

This is a simple version of how we identify for example fellons by matching their DNA
to DNA in the police database.
